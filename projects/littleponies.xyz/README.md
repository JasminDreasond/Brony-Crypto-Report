#### Website

The website is extremely simple. It does not have any extra functionality. For an attempt to create an NFT website, this page is extremely suspicious.

The website source code is also encrypting the page's javascript, making any attempt to debug the source code difficult for security analysis.

The website creator seems to be doing everything the creator can to hide the source code of both the website and the NFT smart contract.

#### The Smart Contract is Verified Contract?
NO! ⚠️

#### Banned from OpenSea or other NFT Websites?
YES! ⚠️

#### Is the contract decompiled to be publicly analyzed?
NO! ⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔

#### Final Result
Extremely high scammer probability level 🔥🔥🔥🔥
