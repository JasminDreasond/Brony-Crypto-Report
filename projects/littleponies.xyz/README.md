#### Website

The website is extremely simple. It does not have any extra functionality. For an attempt to create an NFT website, this page is extremely suspicious. The website tries to connect to your crypto wallet even before you do anything else.

The website source code is also encrypting the page's javascript, making any attempt to debug the source code difficult for security analysis.

The website creator seems to be doing everything to hide the source code of both the website and the NFT smart contract.

#### Has the developer identified himself?

NO! ⚠️

#### Has the developer published the NFT White Paper?

NO! ⚠️

#### The Smart Contract is Verified Contract?

NO! ⚠️

#### Banned from OpenSea or other NFT Websites?

YES! ⚠️

#### Is the contract decompiled to be publicly analyzed?

NO! ⛔⛔⛔⛔⛔

#### Final Result

Extremely high scammer probability level 🔥🔥🔥🔥
