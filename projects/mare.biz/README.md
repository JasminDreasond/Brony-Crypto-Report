The Token is using a Proxy system and at the same time it can change its name through a function called setName. Token can also change symbol identity simply using another function called setSymbol

The Token can also easily modify its number of decimals using setDecimals.

(POLYGON) There is a mysterious empty wallet with 45% of the tokens. Maybe it's some wallet planning to prevent websites from detecting that almost all tokens are in the token owner's wallet.

(POLYGON) The second largest holder belongs to the creator of the token. The project owner can at some point give up on the project and completely liquidate all users. 

I couldn't find contact details of possible friends of the Token owner who are participating in the project. If you find them, please contact me.

The owner of the token's logo icon is anonymous. I cannot know the real reasons for this. So that opens the door to many theories of the real reason for this.

The project is in production, but has no plans as to why it exists. It has a website already stating that you can buy the tokens, but says the project has no plans to use it yet.

Mysteriously, this user's wallet has the NFT derpibooru.eth registered, pointing the domain to his own wallet. (demonstrating that this person wants to receive crypto when the user enters this name.) But the user doesn't seem to show that this user belongs to the derpibooru.org team.

#### Final Result

Questionable project. This page will only be removed if I have better information proving it to be a trusted token. My recommendation is to publish token projects only when the project has a more detailed structure about project development. I am open to any attempt to contact the project owner.

My other recommendation is to avoid maintaining functions that modify the token's identity. 
This type of resource can be suspicious of the user trying to make some identity change without warning. If the creator is using a contract proxy, I'm sure the creator can fix that.

This project could be considered suspicion level 1. But due to reports about this user's NFTs, I'm upgrading to level 2.
